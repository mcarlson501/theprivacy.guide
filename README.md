> A gamified web application that transforms digital privacy from overwhelming to achievable through simple, actionable tasks.

## Purpose

The Privacy Guide bridges the gap between complex privacy advice and real-world implementation. Instead of telling people what they *should* do, we provide clear, step-by-step guidance that anyone can follow—regardless of their technical background.

**Our Core Belief:** Privacy protection shouldn't require a computer science degree.

## ✨ Key Features

### **📰 Privacy Pulse News**
Breaking privacy news with expert analysis, connecting current events to actionable privacy improvements.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Content-Driven Approach**
The entire application revolves around **Markdown content management**, making it easy for privacy experts to contribute without coding knowledge.

## 🛡️ Privacy-by-Design Architecture

Unlike most web applications, The Privacy Guide is built with **privacy as the core architectural principle**:

### **Zero Data Collection**
- Complete functionality without personal information or accounts
- No tracking, analytics, cookies, or behavioral monitoring  
- All resources self-hosted to prevent data leakage
- Your progress stays on your device via browser localStorage

### **Full Data Control**
- View exactly what's stored locally in your browser
- Export your complete progress in standard JSON format
- Import progress between devices or browsers
- One-click data clearing with immediate effect

### **Technical Privacy Measures**
- Static generation eliminates server-side tracking opportunities
- Self-hosted fonts and assets (no Google Fonts requests)
- Client-side processing with no external JavaScript
- Content Security Policy prevents unauthorized data transmission

## 🎯 Content Philosophy

Privacy guidance should be **empowering, not fearful**—focusing on practical solutions over theoretical perfection. Every task is tested across platforms with clear, jargon-free instructions.

### **Independence & Integrity**
- No advertising, sponsorships, or affiliate commissions
- Recommendations based solely on security research and effectiveness
- Community-driven development and feedback
- Complete transparency through open source code

### **Task Categories**
- **Quick Wins** (5-10 minutes): Immediate privacy improvements
- **Essential** (15-30 minutes): Core privacy protection
