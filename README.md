> A gamified web application that transforms digital privacy from overwhelming to achievable through simple, actionable tasks.

## Purpose

The Privacy Guide bridges the gap between complex privacy advice and real-world implementation. Instead of telling people what they *should* do, we provide clear, step-by-step guidance that anyone can followâ€”regardless of their technical background.

**Our Core Belief:** Privacy protection shouldn't require a computer science degree.

## Key Features

### **Interactive Privacy Tasks**
13 progressive tasks from 5-minute "Quick Wins" to comprehensive "Advanced" guides with step-by-step instructions and real-world impact.

### **Gamified Experience**  
Earn points, badges, and levels as you progress from "Privacy Novice" to "Privacy Expert" through an engaging visual dashboard.

### **Privacy Pulse News**
Breaking privacy news with expert analysis, connecting current events to actionable privacy improvements.

### **Privacy-First Architecture**
Zero data collection, local-only storage, no tracking, and complete data portabilityâ€”practice what we preach.

### **Accessible Design**
WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with dark mode, mobile responsiveness, and semantic HTML structure.

## Architecture Overview

### **Content-Driven Approach**
The entire application revolves around **Markdown content management**, making it easy for privacy experts to contribute without coding knowledge.

```
Content Structure:
â”œâ”€â”€ content/tasks/        # Privacy task guides (.md files)
â”œâ”€â”€ content/news/         # Privacy news articles (.md files)
â””â”€â”€ Automatic Processing  # Tasks become interactive experiences
```

## Privacy-by-Design Architecture

Unlike most web applications, The Privacy Guide is built with **privacy as the core architectural principle**:

### **Zero Data Collection**
- Complete functionality without personal information or accounts
- No tracking, analytics, cookies, or behavioral monitoring  
- All resources self-hosted to prevent data leakage
- Your progress stays on your device via browser localStorage

### **Full Data Control**
- View exactly what's stored locally in your browser
- Export your complete progress in standard JSON format
- Import progress between devices or browsers
- One-click data clearing with immediate effect

### **Technical Privacy Measures**
- Static generation eliminates server-side tracking opportunities
- Self-hosted fonts and assets (no Google Fonts requests)
- Client-side processing with no external JavaScript
- Content Security Policy prevents unauthorized data transmission

## Content Philosophy

Privacy guidance should be **empowering, not fearful**â€”focusing on practical solutions over theoretical perfection. Every task is tested across platforms with clear, jargon-free instructions.

### **Task Categories**
- **Quick Wins** (5-10 minutes): Immediate privacy improvements
- **Essential** (15-30 minutes): Core privacy protection  
- **Advanced** (30+ minutes): Enhanced privacy controls
