> A gamified web application that transforms digital privacy from overwhelming to achievable through simple, actionable tasks.

## Purpose

The Privacy Guide bridges the gap between complex privacy advice and real-world implementation. Instead of telling people what they *should* do, we provide clear, step-by-step guidance that anyone can followâ€”regardless of their technical background.

**Our Core Belief:** Privacy protection shouldn't require a computer science degree.
