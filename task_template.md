# Content Creation Guide & Template

This document provides the guiding language for the main content sections and the official template for creating new tasks for The Privacy Guide.

## Guiding Language

Use this introductory text at the top of the respective content pages to set the right tone for our users.

### For the "Quick Wins" Section:

> **Your journey to better privacy starts here.**
>
> Think of these as small, simple first steps. Each Quick Win is a high-impact task you can complete in **about 5-10 minutes**. You don't need to be a tech expert—we'll walk you through everything. Let's build some momentum and make you safer online, one win at a time!

### For the "Weekend Projects" Section:

> **Ready to dive a little deeper?**
>
> These projects take a bit more time but offer a huge boost to your online privacy. Set aside a bit of time on a Saturday morning or a quiet afternoon to tackle one. We'll guide you through every step. Think of this as your digital "spring cleaning"—a rewarding effort that leaves you feeling more secure and in control.

## Task Creation Template

### Template:

```markdown

* **Category:** [e.g., Browser Basics]
* **Estimated Time:** ☕️ About 5 minutes
* **Points Value:** 50 Points

#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)

Think of your search engine like a personal assistant. Every time you ask it a question, it remembers what you asked, where you asked from, and what you clicked on. Some assistants use this memory to build a detailed profile about you to sell to advertisers. Our goal is to switch to an assistant that has a very bad memory on purpose—one that treats every question like the first time you've ever met.

#### What This Accomplishes (How It Helps)

* Stops your search engine from building a personal profile on you.
* Reduces the number of targeted ads you see around the web.
* Keeps your search history private and separate from your other online accounts (like Google or Microsoft).
