## What Happened

> **MAJOR BREACH ALERT:** On July 28, 2025, TransUnion—one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States—experienced a significant data breach that exposed personal information belonging to **over 4.4 million Americans**.

The attack was discovered just two days later, but hackers had already made off with a treasure trove of sensitive customer data.

### The Attack Details

This wasn't a simple website hack. The attackers targeted **TransUnion's Salesforce customer support system**, which contained detailed records of people who had requested credit reports or interacted with customer service. 

Think of it like burglars breaking into a filing cabinet that contained some of your most personal information.

## Who Is Affected

### You might be impacted if you:

- Requested a free credit report from TransUnion recently
- Contacted TransUnion customer support in the past year  
- Have any relationship with TransUnion's consumer services

### What information was stolen:

- **Personal Information:** Full names and addresses
- **Contact Details:** Phone numbers and email addresses
- **Social Security Numbers:** Completely unredacted SSNs
- **Birth Information:** Dates of birth
- **Service Records:** Reasons for contacting customer support
- **Communications:** Customer service tickets and messages

> **Important:** TransUnion says that core credit reports and credit information were **NOT** accessed in this breach. However, the stolen data is still extremely valuable to identity thieves.

## What You Should Do Right Now

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

> **Take these steps within the next 7 days to protect yourself.**

**1. Check if you're affected**
- Watch for notification letters from TransUnion
- If you've received a letter, you're confirmed to be impacted
- Even without a letter, assume you could be affected if you've used TransUnion services

**2. Get free credit monitoring**
- TransUnion is offering 24 months of free credit monitoring to affected customers
- Sign up immediately when you receive your notification letter
- This will alert you to new accounts opened in your name

**3. Place a fraud alert**
- Contact any one of the three credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian)
- Request a fraud alert—makes it harder for someone to open accounts in your name
- Lasts 90 days and all three bureaus will be notified automatically

---

### Actions for This Month

> **Complete these additional protections within 30 days.**

**4. Consider a credit freeze**
- Completely blocks access to your credit report
- No one (including you) can open new accounts until you lift the freeze
- It's free and more secure than fraud alerts
- Contact all three credit bureaus separately

**5. Monitor all accounts closely**
- Check bank accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts weekly
- Look for unfamiliar transactions, even small ones
- Set up account alerts for any transaction over $1

**6. Update your passwords**
- Change passwords for any financial accounts
- Use a password manager to create unique, strong passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible

## How to Stay Protected Going Forward

### Build Strong Defense Habits

**Use a Password Manager**
With your Social Security Number in criminal hands, strong, unique passwords become even more critical. A password manager creates different passwords for every account, so if one site gets hacked, criminals can't access your other accounts.

**Enable Two-Factor Authentication**
Even if criminals have your password, two-factor authentication acts like a second lock they can't break. Set this up on all financial accounts, email, and any site that offers it.

**Learn to Spot Phishing**
Criminals will likely use the stolen TransUnion data to create convincing phishing emails. They might email you pretending to be your bank, using your real name and partial information to seem legitimate. Always navigate to websites directly rather than clicking email links.

### Long-term Protection Strategy

**Regular Credit Monitoring**
- Check your credit reports from all three bureaus at least twice a year
- Use annualcreditreport.com for free reports
- Consider a paid credit monitoring service for real-time alerts

**Document Everything**
- Keep records of all breach notifications you receive
- Save correspondence with TransUnion about this incident
- If you become a victim of identity theft, having this documentation helps prove the timeline

## Why This Matters More Than Usual

This breach is particularly serious because:

**1. It's a Credit Bureau**
TransUnion is supposed to be protecting your financial information, not exposing it. This creates a crisis of trust in the system designed to safeguard your creditworthiness.

**2. Complete Social Security Numbers**
Unlike many breaches where SSNs are partially redacted, these were stored in full. Your SSN is like a master key to your financial life—it's used to open accounts, take out loans, and verify your identity.

**3. Part of a Bigger Pattern**
This is connected to a wave of Salesforce attacks hitting major companies throughout 2025. The same criminal groups (including "Shiny Hunters") have hit Google, Farmers Insurance, and many others. This suggests organized, professional cybercriminal operations.

---

**Remember**: This breach affects millions of people, so you're not alone. Take the protective steps above, but don't panic. With proper precautions, you can protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft even when your personal information has been compromised.
