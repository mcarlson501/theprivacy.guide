## What Happened

TransUnion—one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States—experienced a significant data breach on July 28, 2025, exposing personal information belonging to **over 4.4 million Americans**.

Attackers targeted TransUnion's Salesforce customer support system, which contained detailed records of people who had requested credit reports or contacted customer service. The stolen data includes:

- **Personal Information:** Full names and addresses
- **Contact Details:** Phone numbers and email addresses  
- **Social Security Numbers:** Completely unredacted SSNs
- **Birth Information:** Dates of birth
- **Service Records:** Customer service interactions

> **Important:** TransUnion confirms that core credit reports and credit information were NOT accessed in this breach.

## Who Is Affected

You might be impacted if you:
- Requested a free credit report from TransUnion recently
- Contacted TransUnion customer support in the past year
- Have any relationship with TransUnion's consumer services

## What You Should Do

**This Week:**

1. **Watch for notification letters** from TransUnion confirming if you're affected
2. **Sign up for free credit monitoring** when you receive your letter (24 months provided)  
3. **Place a fraud alert** by contacting any credit bureau—it covers all three automatically

**This Month:**

4. **Consider a credit freeze** for stronger protection (blocks all access to your credit report)
5. **Monitor all accounts closely** and set up transaction alerts
6. **Update passwords** for financial accounts using a password manager

## How to Stay Protected

**Use Strong, Unique Passwords**  
With your Social Security Number potentially in criminal hands, password security becomes critical. A password manager creates different passwords for every account.

**Enable Two-Factor Authentication**  
Add this extra security layer to all financial accounts and email—even if criminals have your password, they can't access your accounts.

**Learn to Spot Phishing**  
Criminals may use your stolen data to create convincing fake emails. Always navigate to websites directly rather than clicking email links.

## Why This Matters

This breach is particularly serious because it involves a credit bureau that's supposed to protect your financial information, and the attackers obtained complete Social Security Numbers—your master key to financial identity.

This incident is part of a larger pattern of Salesforce attacks hitting major companies throughout 2025, suggesting organized cybercriminal operations.

**Remember:** Millions of people are affected, so you're not alone. Take the protective steps above, but don't panic. With proper precautions, you can prevent identity theft even when your information has been compromised.
