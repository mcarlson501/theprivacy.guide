#### Why This Matters
Your social media profiles are like your front yard - by default, they're often visible to anyone walking by. Most people set up accounts quickly and never revisit privacy settings, which means strangers, employers, and scammers might see much more than you intended. This is your digital privacy fence - you decide who gets to see into your personal life.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Made your social media posts private by default so only friends can see them
* Stopped strangers from finding and contacting you through social media platforms
* Removed personal information that could be used for identity theft or scams

### Step 1: Make Your Posts Private by Default
Stop sharing with strangers automatically.

**Facebook:**
1. Click the down arrow (top right) → Settings & Privacy → Settings
2. Click "Privacy" → "Who can see your future posts?" → Select "Friends"
3. Click "Limit Past Posts" to make old public posts friends-only
4. "Do you want search engines to link to your profile?" → Select "No"

**Instagram:**
1. Profile → Three lines → Settings and Privacy → Account Privacy
2. Turn ON "Private Account" 
3. Settings → Privacy → Activity Status → Turn OFF (hides when you're online)

**Twitter/X:**
1. More → Settings and Privacy → Privacy and Safety
2. Audience and Tagging → Check "Protect your posts" (makes account private)
3. Location information → Uncheck "Add location to tweets"

### Step 2: Control Who Can Contact You
Stop strangers from finding and messaging you.

**Facebook:**
1. Privacy settings → "Who can send friend requests?" → "Friends of friends" (not Everyone)
2. "Who can look you up using email/phone?" → "Friends" or "Friends of friends"
3. Timeline and Tagging → "Who can post on your timeline?" → "Friends"

**Instagram:**
1. Settings → Privacy → Messages → Choose who can message you
2. Story → Choose "Close Friends" for who can see your stories
3. Turn OFF "Allow sharing to other apps"

**LinkedIn:**
1. Me → Settings & Privacy → Visibility → "Profile viewing options" → "Private mode"
2. "Active status" → Turn OFF
3. "Manage who can see your connections" → "Only you"

### Step 3: Remove Personal Information Red Flags
Clean up information that could be used against you.

**Remove These From All Platforms:**
- Phone numbers in bio or posts
- Full birth dates (keep day/month, remove year)
- Home address or specific locations 
- Real-time vacation posts (post after you return)
- Photos showing house numbers or license plates

**Location Privacy:**
- Turn OFF location services for all social media apps in your phone settings
- Remove location tags from old posts
- Stop checking in to specific places

**Quick Test:**
1. Log out of your accounts
2. Search for yourself while logged out
3. If you can see more than you're comfortable with, tighten your settings

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've made your social media accounts much more private. Strangers can no longer see your posts, find you easily, or contact you directly. Your personal information is no longer broadcasting to the world.

**What to Expect**
Social media companies frequently update their settings and often reset them to be more public (because they make money from your data). Check your privacy settings every few months to make sure they haven't changed.

**Pro Tips**
The goal isn't to avoid social media - it's to share intentionally with people you actually want to share with. You've just put up a digital privacy fence around your social media life.

**Remember:** Privacy settings are deliberately buried and confusing because social media companies profit from your data being public. You just outsmarted their system by taking control of your digital privacy.
