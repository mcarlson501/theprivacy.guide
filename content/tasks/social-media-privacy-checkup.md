#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)
Your social media profiles are like your front yard‚Äîby default, they're often visible to anyone walking by. Most people set up their accounts quickly and never revisit the privacy settings, which means strangers, employers, advertisers, and even scammers might be seeing much more than you intended. Think of this task as putting up a privacy fence around your digital life.

#### What This Accomplishes (How It Helps)
* **Controls who sees your content:** Only share with people you actually want to share with
* **Reduces unwanted contact:** Stop strangers from messaging or finding you easily
* **Protects your location:** Prevent accidentally broadcasting where you are or have been
* **Limits data collection:** Reduce how much platforms can learn about you for advertising
* **Prevents embarrassing discoveries:** Keep old posts from surfacing at inappropriate times
