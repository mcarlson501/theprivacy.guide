#### Why This Matters
Using your main email address for everything is like giving out your home phone number to every store, website, and service. Once it's out there, it gets shared, sold, and eventually flooded with spam.

When companies get hacked (and they do regularly), your email address gets leaked along with millions of others. Having a separate "public" email keeps your important email clean and makes it harder for criminals to target your banking and personal accounts.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* A clean main email for important accounts only
* A separate email for shopping and signups that protects your privacy
* Reduced spam in your important inbox

---

### Step 1: Create Your "Public" Email
Set up a second email address for shopping and signups.

1. Go to Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook and create a new email account
2. Choose a simple name like `yourname.shopping@gmail.com` or `yournamepublic@gmail.com`
3. Use the same password as your main email (we'll fix this with a password manager later)
4. Add this email to your phone's email app so you can check both easily

**Note:** This becomes your "throwaway" email for anything that's not truly important.

---

### Step 2: Decide What Goes Where
Create clear rules for which email to use when.

**Use your MAIN email for:**
* Banking and credit cards
* Work and professional contacts
* Family and close friends
* Government services and taxes
* Medical and insurance accounts

**Use your PUBLIC email for:**
* Online shopping (Amazon, Target, etc.)
* Social media accounts
* Newsletters and subscriptions
* Free trials and downloads
* Any website that requires signup just to read content

---

### Step 3: Start Using Your New System
Begin protecting your main email immediately.

1. For the next week, use your public email for any new signups
2. When shopping online, use your public email instead of your main one
3. If you're unsure which email to use, choose the public one - you can always change it later
4. Don't worry about changing existing accounts yet - just start fresh with new signups

**Remember:** The goal is to keep your main email address known by as few companies as possible.

---

### Step 4: Know When to Protect Your Real Email
Use this guide to decide which email to use for different types of accounts.

**Always use your primary email for:**
* Banks, credit cards, and investment accounts
* Government websites (IRS, DMV, voting registration)
* Health insurance and medical providers
* Your employer and professional contacts
* Important utilities (electric, gas, internet)

**Always use your secondary email for:**
* Social media platforms
* Online shopping (non-financial parts)
* Newsletter subscriptions
* Forum registrations
* App downloads and accounts

**Never use your primary email for:**
* Free WiFi signups at stores or airports
* Contest entries and giveaways
* Downloading free ebooks or software
* Sites that feel sketchy or unprofessional
* Any service offering something "too good to be true"

---

### Step 5: Audit and Clean Up Your Email
Conduct a regular review to keep your system working well.

1. Go through your primary email inbox from the past 6 months
2. Create a list of every service that emails you
3. Move shopping and entertainment accounts to your secondary email
4. Unsubscribe from legitimate companies you no longer want to hear from
5. Mark unknown senders as spam instead of unsubscribing (unsubscribing confirms your email is active)
6. Use Have I Been Pwned (haveibeenpwned.com) to check if your emails appear in data breaches

**Note:** Take screenshots of important account emails before migrating, so you have records of confirmation numbers and account details.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've created a simple system that protects your main email from spam, data breaches, and unwanted sharing. Your important accounts now have a cleaner, more secure inbox.

**What to Expect**
Your main email will stay much cleaner since only trusted contacts and important services have it. Your public email might get more spam, but that's the point - it's protecting your real inbox.

**Pro Tips**
* Check both emails daily for the first week to get comfortable with the system
* If a service is truly important, you can always move it to your main email later
* Consider this practice for any new accounts: ask yourself "Is this main email worthy?"

**Remember:** This simple two-email system gives you control over who has access to your most important inbox. It's a small change that makes a big difference in your digital privacy.
