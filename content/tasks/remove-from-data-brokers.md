#### Why This Matters
Right now, there are dozens of websites publishing your full name, home address, phone number, age, relatives' names, and sometimes even your email — all for anyone to find with a simple search. These are called data broker or "people-search" sites, and they collect your information from public records, social media, shopping habits, and other sources.

Stalkers, scammers, telemarketers, and identity thieves all use these sites. Anyone can look you up in seconds. The good news is that every one of these sites is legally required to remove your information when you ask. The bad news is that there are a lot of them, so it takes some time to work through the list.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Found out exactly what personal information is publicly available about you online
* Submitted removal requests to the biggest data broker sites
* Learned how to keep your information from reappearing over time

---

### Step 1: See What's Out There
Start by searching for yourself to understand what's publicly available.

1. Open a private/incognito browser window (so your past searches don't affect results)
2. Search Google for your full name in quotes: "Jane Smith" (use your real name)
3. Add your city to narrow it down: "Jane Smith" "Denver" or "Jane Smith" Denver CO
4. Look through the first 2-3 pages of results for people-search sites
5. Make a note of which sites show your information

**Common sites you'll likely find:**
- Spokeo.com
- WhitePages.com
- BeenVerified.com
- PeopleFinder.com
- FastPeopleSearch.com
- TruePeopleSearch.com
- Radaris.com

**Note:** Don't panic if you find a lot. This is completely normal — almost every adult in the US appears on these sites. You're about to fix it.

### Step 2: Remove Yourself from the Biggest Sites
Work through the major data brokers one at a time. Each site has a different removal process.

**Spokeo:**
1. Go to spokeo.com/optout
2. Find your listing by searching your name
3. Copy the URL of your specific listing
4. Paste it into the opt-out form and enter your email
5. Check your email and click the confirmation link

**WhitePages:**
1. Go to whitepages.com/suppression-requests
2. Search for your listing
3. Click "Remove me" next to your record
4. Verify with a phone call (they'll call and give you a code)

**FastPeopleSearch:**
1. Go to fastpeoplesearch.com/removal
2. Find your listing on their site first
3. Copy the link to your listing
4. Paste it into their removal form
5. Check your email to confirm

**TruePeopleSearch:**
1. Go to truepeoplesearch.com/removal
2. Find your record
3. Click "Remove This Record"
4. Complete the verification

**Note:** Each removal typically takes 24-72 hours to process. Don't worry if your listing doesn't disappear immediately.

### Step 3: Submit Removal Requests to More Sites
Continue with the remaining major data brokers.

**BeenVerified:**
1. Go to beenverified.com/faq/opt-out
2. Follow their opt-out instructions
3. Verify your identity as requested

**Radaris:**
1. Go to radaris.com/control/privacy
2. Search for your listing
3. Click "Remove" and follow the steps
4. Verify by email

**PeopleFinder:**
1. Go to peoplefinder.com/optout
2. Search for and find your record
3. Submit the opt-out request
4. Confirm by email

**Tip:** This step takes the most time, but you don't have to do every site in one sitting. Bookmark any sites you want to come back to and finish them over the next few days.

---

### Step 4: Set Up an Annual Checkup
Data brokers frequently re-add your information, so you'll need to check back periodically.

1. Set a calendar reminder for every 6 months: "Check data broker sites"
2. When the reminder comes up, repeat Step 1 — search for yourself
3. Submit new removal requests for any sites where you've reappeared
4. It gets faster each time because you already know the process

**Why they come back:** Data brokers buy new data regularly from public records, marketing lists, and other sources. Your information may reappear even after successful removal. This is normal and not a sign that you did something wrong.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've removed your personal information from the major people-search websites that were broadcasting your name, address, phone number, and other details to anyone who searched for you. This significantly reduces your exposure to stalkers, scammers, and identity thieves.

**What to Expect**
Removals take 24-72 hours to process. After that, searching for yourself should return far fewer results. Some sites may re-add your information over time, which is why the 6-month checkup is important.

**Pro Tips**
* Take a screenshot of each removal confirmation for your records
* If you want a service to handle this automatically, EasyOptOuts.com, Kanary, and DeleteMe are reputable paid options that continuously monitor and remove your data
* When signing up for new services, use your secondary email and minimal personal details to reduce future exposure

**Remember:** Every listing you remove is one less place where strangers, scammers, and data collectors can find your personal details. You've just made yourself significantly harder to find online.
