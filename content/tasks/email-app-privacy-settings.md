#### Why This Matters
Your email app tracks when you read messages, what links you click, and even where you are when you check email. Many emails contain invisible tracking pixels that report back to senders the moment you open them. Email apps also upload your contacts to company servers and track your communication patterns.

Companies use this data to build detailed profiles about your habits, relationships, and interests. A few privacy settings can stop most of this tracking while keeping your email working perfectly.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Blocked tracking pixels that monitor when you read emails
* Stopped your email app from uploading your contacts to company servers
* Hidden your email reading patterns and habits from data collectors

### Step 1: Block Email Tracking
Stop companies from monitoring when you read emails.

**iPhone Mail:**
1. Settings → Mail → Privacy Protection
2. Turn ON "Protect Mail Activity" (blocks all tracking)
3. Settings → Mail → Turn OFF "Send Read Receipts"

**Gmail App:**
1. Open Gmail → Profile picture → Settings → General
2. Images → Choose "Ask before displaying external images"
3. Turn OFF "Web clips" to reduce data collection

**Outlook App:**
1. Settings → Mail → Reading
2. Turn OFF "Request read receipt" and "Send read receipt"
3. Settings → Privacy → Turn OFF "Help improve Outlook"

---

### Step 2: Protect Your Contacts
Stop your email app from uploading your address book to company servers.

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → Mail → Accounts
2. Tap each email account → Turn OFF "Contacts"
3. This keeps your contacts local to your device only

**Android:**
1. Settings → Apps → [Your email app] → Permissions
2. Turn OFF "Contacts" access
3. Your email will still work, but won't share your contact list

**Why this matters:** Email apps often upload everyone's contact information to build social networks and target advertising.

---

### Step 3: Hide Email Content from Lock Screen
Keep your private messages private when your phone is locked.

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → Notifications → Mail
2. Show Previews → Choose "When Unlocked" (or "Never" for maximum privacy)
3. Turn OFF "Show on Lock Screen" for sensitive email accounts

**Android:**
1. Settings → Apps → [Email App] → Notifications
2. Advanced → Choose "Hide sensitive content"
3. This shows you have emails without revealing the content

**Remember:** Anyone can see notification previews on your lock screen, including email subject lines and sender names.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've blocked email tracking pixels, stopped your contacts from being uploaded to company servers, and hidden private email content from your lock screen. Your email apps now respect your privacy much better.

**What to Expect**
Your email will work exactly the same, but companies can no longer track when you read messages or access your contact list. Your notifications won't reveal private information to anyone looking at your phone.

**Pro Tips**
* Be selective about which emails you allow to load images - only trust senders you recognize
* Regularly review your email app permissions as they can change with updates
* Consider using separate email addresses for shopping vs. important personal accounts

**Remember:** Email tracking is everywhere, but these simple settings block most of it while keeping your email fully functional. You've taken back control of your digital communication privacy.
