#### Why This Matters
Google probably knows more about you than your closest friends. Every search you make, every place you go with your phone, every YouTube video you watch, and every website you visit while signed in — Google records all of it. They use this information to build an incredibly detailed profile about you that advertisers pay for.

The good news? Google actually gives you a tool to turn most of this tracking off. Most people just don't know it exists. It takes a few minutes to go through, and you'll still be able to use Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube exactly the same way.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Stopped Google from saving your search and browsing history
* Turned off location tracking that follows you everywhere
* Removed old data Google has already collected about you

### Step 1: Open Google's Privacy Checkup
Google built a step-by-step privacy tool — most people just never find it.

1. Open your web browser and go to myaccount.google.com
2. Sign in with your Google/Gmail account if you aren't already
3. Click "Data & privacy" in the left menu (or tap the menu icon on mobile)
4. Scroll down and click "Privacy Checkup" — or go directly to myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup

**Note:** This works on your phone or computer. Use whichever is easier for you.

### Step 2: Turn Off Activity Tracking
Stop Google from recording everything you do.

**Web & App Activity:**
1. You'll see "Web & App Activity" — click or tap it
2. Click "Turn off" to stop Google from saving your searches and browsing
3. When asked, confirm by clicking "Pause"
4. Click "Manage activity" and then "Delete" to remove old saved searches

**YouTube History:**
1. Find "YouTube History" in the checkup
2. Click "Turn off" to stop saving what you watch
3. Click "Manage activity" to delete your old watch history

**Location History:**
1. Find "Location History" (also called "Timeline")
2. Click "Turn off" to stop tracking where you go
3. Click "Manage activity" and delete your old location data

**Note:** Turning these off does not affect how Google Maps gives you directions or how YouTube recommends videos. Everything still works normally.

### Step 3: Limit Ad Personalization
Reduce how much Google uses your data for targeted advertising.

1. Go back to myaccount.google.com and click "Data & privacy"
2. Scroll down to "Ad personalization" and click it
3. Click "Turn off ad personalization"
4. Confirm by clicking "Turn off"

**What this means:** You'll still see ads (Google shows ads no matter what), but they won't be based on your personal profile. Many people find this less creepy — no more ads for things you just talked about or searched for.

---

### Step 4: Set Auto-Delete for Safety
Tell Google to automatically delete any future data it collects, just in case.

1. Go to myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols
2. For each activity type (Web & App Activity, Location History, YouTube History), click it
3. Look for "Auto-delete" and set it to "3 months" — this is the shortest option
4. Confirm your choice

**Why this matters:** Even if a setting gets accidentally turned back on, Google will automatically erase the data after 3 months instead of keeping it forever.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've told Google to stop recording your searches, locations, and browsing activity. You've also cleared out old data they already had on you and set up automatic deletion as a safety net.

**What to Expect**
Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, and all other Google services will work exactly the same. You won't notice any difference in how they work — the only change is that Google is no longer building a detailed profile of your life behind the scenes.

**Pro Tips**
* Bookmark myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup and revisit it every few months — Google sometimes adds new settings
* If you use an Android phone, these changes also apply to your phone's Google activity
* Check myaccount.google.com/permissions to see which apps have access to your Google account and remove any you don't recognize

**Remember:** Google makes it easy to use their privacy tools, but they don't advertise them because they profit from your data. Now you know where to find them.
