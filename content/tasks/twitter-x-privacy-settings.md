#### Why This Matters
Twitter/X is designed to be public, but it collects massive amounts of personal data beyond your tweets. The platform tracks your location, who you interact with, what you click on, and even websites you visit outside of Twitter. Your tweets and profile can be found by employers, scammers, and stalkers.

Twitter's open nature also makes it a hotspot for harassment and unwanted contact. A few privacy settings can dramatically reduce spam, protect your location, and limit who can bother you while keeping the social experience you value.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Control over who can message and contact you directly
* Location tracking turned off to protect where you live and work
* Reduced data collection and targeted advertising

### Step 1: Control Who Can Contact You
Stop strangers from messaging and bothering you.

1. Go to Settings → Privacy and Safety → Direct Messages
2. Turn off "Receive messages from anyone"
3. Only allow messages from people you follow
4. Enable "Filter low-quality messages"
5. Settings → Privacy and Safety → Discoverability and Contacts
6. Turn off "Let others find you by your email address"
7. Turn off "Let others find you by your phone number"

**Note:** This dramatically reduces spam messages and unwanted contact while keeping Twitter useful.

### Step 2: Turn Off Location Tracking
Stop Twitter from broadcasting where you live and work.

1. Settings → Privacy and Safety → Location Information
2. Turn off "Precise location"
3. Click "Remove location information from past tweets"
4. On your phone: Settings → Privacy → Location Services → Twitter → Never

**Remember:** Twitter's location data has been used to track protesters, journalists, and activists. Turn this off even if you don't add location to tweets.

### Step 3: Limit Data Collection and Ads
Reduce how much Twitter tracks your activity for advertising.

1. Settings → Privacy and Safety → Ads Preferences
2. Turn off "Personalized ads"
3. Settings → Privacy and Safety → Data Sharing and Off-Twitter Activity
4. Turn off "Allow additional information sharing with business partners"
5. Turn off "Track where you see Twitter content across the web"

**This prevents:** Twitter from tracking what websites you visit and sharing your data with advertisers.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've significantly reduced unwanted contact, location tracking, and data collection on Twitter/X while keeping the platform's core social and news features. Strangers can't easily find or message you, and your location stays private.

**What to Expect**
You'll see fewer spam messages, less creepy targeted ads, and more control over who can interact with you. Twitter remains useful for news and conversations, but with much better privacy protection.

**Pro Tips**
* Use the block and mute features liberally - you don't owe anyone access to you
* Be careful about photos that might reveal your location or personal details
* Remember that tweets are public and can be screenshotted even if you delete them

**Remember:** Twitter is designed to be public, so think carefully about what you share. These settings give you much more control while keeping the social experience you value.
