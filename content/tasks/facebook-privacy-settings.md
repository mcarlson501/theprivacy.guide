#### Why This Matters
Facebook knows more about you than almost any other company - not just what you post, but where you go, what you buy, and even what you look at without clicking on. They track your activity across millions of websites and apps, building a detailed profile for advertising.

With over 3 billion users, deleting Facebook isn't realistic for most people. Instead, you can significantly limit what they collect and who sees your information through privacy settings that actually work.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Limited how much Facebook tracks your activity outside their platform
* Controlled who can see your posts and personal information
* Reduced targeted advertising based on your personal data

### Step 1: Lock Down Your Profile Visibility
Control who can see your posts and personal information.

1. Go to Settings & Privacy → Settings → Privacy
2. Click "Who can see your future posts?" and change from "Public" to "Friends"
3. Go to your Profile and click "About"
4. Review each section (Work, Education, Contact Info) and change visibility from "Public" to "Friends"
5. Pay special attention to phone number, email, and current city

**Note:** Your profile is often the first thing people see when they search your name.

### Step 2: Control Location Tracking
Stop Facebook from tracking everywhere you go.

1. On your phone: Go to Settings → Privacy → Location Services
2. Find Facebook and change to "Never" or "While Using App"
3. In Facebook: Go to Settings → Privacy → Location Settings
4. Turn off "Location History" and "Background Location"
5. Review old location posts in your Profile → "Check-ins" and delete unwanted ones

### Step 3: Limit Advertising Data Collection
Reduce how Facebook uses your data for targeted ads.

1. Go to Settings → Ads → Ad Preferences
2. Click "Your information" and review what Facebook thinks it knows about you
3. Turn off "Ads based on data from partners"
4. Turn off "Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products"
5. Review and remove interests that feel too personal or inaccurate

#### Apps and Websites
1. **Go to Settings** → **Apps and Websites**
2. **Review connected apps** and remove any you don't actively use
3. **Turn off "Apps, websites and games"** if you don't use Facebook to log into other services
4. **Limit "Instant Personalization"** to prevent automatic data sharing

**Facebook-Specific Risk:** Facebook shares your data with thousands of partner companies. Even if you trust Facebook, you might not trust all their partners.

### Step 4: Smart Posting Habits

#### Before You Post, Ask:
* **Would I be comfortable if this was on a billboard?** (Because it might be seen by more people than you think)
* **Could this be taken out of context?** (Facebook posts can be screenshotted and shared)
* **Am I posting when emotional?** (Wait a few hours before posting about controversial topics)

#### Facebook-Specific Tips:
* **Avoid "checking in" at your home** or posting when you're away on vacation
* **Be careful with "People You May Know"** suggestions—they often reveal who you've been near physically
* **Review photos you're tagged in** before they appear on your timeline
* **Use Facebook's "Take a Break" feature** if you need space from someone without unfriending

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've significantly limited how much Facebook can track your activity and who can see your personal information. While Facebook will always collect some data, you've made it much harder for them to build a complete profile of your life.

**What to Expect**
You'll see fewer creepy targeted ads, less location tracking, and more control over who sees your posts. Your Facebook experience remains the same, but with much better privacy protection.

**Pro Tips**
* Review your privacy settings every few months as Facebook often adds new features
* Be selective about what you post - privacy settings can't protect oversharing
* Consider using Facebook in a separate browser to limit cross-site tracking

**Remember:** You've taken back significant control over your Facebook privacy. These small changes add up to meaningful protection of your personal information.
