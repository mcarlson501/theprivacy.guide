#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)
Facebook knows more about you than almost any other company—not just what you post, but where you go, what you buy, and even what you look at (but don't click on). With over 3 billion users, it's unrealistic to ask people to delete Facebook entirely. Instead, let's make your experience more private while keeping the social connections you value.

#### What This Accomplishes (How It Helps)
* **Limits data collection:** Reduce how much Facebook tracks your activity
* **Controls who sees your content:** Keep personal posts away from strangers and advertisers
* **Reduces targeted advertising:** Fewer creepy ads based on your personal life
* **Protects your location:** Stop broadcasting where you are and where you've been
* **Secures your account:** Prevent unauthorized access and suspicious activity

### What Facebook Really Knows About You

Facebook doesn't just see what you post—they track:
* **Every click and hover** on their platform (even things you don't actually click)
* **Your location** whenever you have the app open
* **What you buy** through partnerships with retailers
* **Your contacts** when you upload your phone's address book
* **Websites you visit** through Facebook pixels and login buttons

**The goal:** Keep using Facebook for what you love, but limit what they can learn about you.

### Step 1: Lock Down Your Profile Visibility

#### Who Can See Your Posts
1. **Go to Settings & Privacy** → **Settings** → **Privacy**
2. **Click "Who can see your future posts?"**
3. **Change from "Public" to "Friends"** (or "Friends except..." for more control)
4. **Review past posts:** Click "Review posts friends have tagged you in"

#### Profile Information
1. **Go to your Profile** and click **"About"**
2. **Review each section** (Work, Education, Contact Info, etc.)
3. **Change visibility** from "Public" to "Friends" or "Only Me"
4. **Pay special attention to:** Phone number, email, and current city

**Facebook-Specific Risk:** Your profile is often the first thing people see when they search your name. Public profiles can be viewed by anyone, including potential employers, scammers, or people with bad intentions.

### Step 2: Control Location Tracking

#### Turn Off Location Services
1. **On your phone:** Go to **Settings** → **Privacy** → **Location Services**
2. **Find Facebook** and change to **"Never"** or **"While Using App"**
3. **In Facebook:** Go to **Settings** → **Privacy** → **Location Settings**
4. **Turn off "Location History"** and **"Background Location"**

#### Review Location Posts
1. **Go to your Profile** → **"Check-ins"**
2. **Review old location posts** and delete any you don't want public
3. **Turn off automatic location tagging** for future posts

**Facebook-Specific Risk:** Facebook's location data is extremely detailed and is often shared with law enforcement. It can also be used to infer your daily routines, workplace, and home address.

### Step 3: Manage What Facebook Shares About You

#### Advertising Preferences
1. **Go to Settings** → **Ads** → **Ad Preferences**
2. **Click "Your information"** and review what Facebook thinks it knows about you
3. **Turn off "Ads based on data from partners"**
4. **Turn off "Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products"**
5. **Review and remove interests** that feel too personal or inaccurate

#### Apps and Websites
1. **Go to Settings** → **Apps and Websites**
2. **Review connected apps** and remove any you don't actively use
3. **Turn off "Apps, websites and games"** if you don't use Facebook to log into other services
4. **Limit "Instant Personalization"** to prevent automatic data sharing

**Facebook-Specific Risk:** Facebook shares your data with thousands of partner companies. Even if you trust Facebook, you might not trust all their partners.

### Step 4: Smart Posting Habits

#### Before You Post, Ask:
* **Would I be comfortable if this was on a billboard?** (Because it might be seen by more people than you think)
* **Could this be taken out of context?** (Facebook posts can be screenshotted and shared)
* **Am I posting when emotional?** (Wait a few hours before posting about controversial topics)

#### Facebook-Specific Tips:
* **Avoid "checking in" at your home** or posting when you're away on vacation
* **Be careful with "People You May Know"** suggestions—they often reveal who you've been near physically
* **Review photos you're tagged in** before they appear on your timeline
* **Use Facebook's "Take a Break" feature** if you need space from someone without unfriending

---

### Step 5: Protect Your Account

#### Security Basics
1. **Go to Settings** → **Security and Login**
2. **Turn on Two-Factor Authentication** (use an authenticator app, not SMS if possible)
3. **Review "Where You're Logged In"** and log out of suspicious locations
4. **Set up login alerts** to know when someone accesses your account

#### Regular Maintenance
* **Review your friends list quarterly**—remove people you don't actually know
* **Check your activity log** to see what Facebook thinks you've done
* **Download your data** once a year to see what Facebook has stored about you

### The Reality Check

**Facebook will always collect data—that's their business model.** But you can significantly reduce how much they collect and how it's used. The goal isn't perfect privacy (that's impossible on Facebook), but rather informed choices about what you're willing to trade for social connection.

**Remember:** Every privacy setting you enable makes it a little harder for Facebook to build a complete picture of your life. Small changes add up to meaningful protection.
