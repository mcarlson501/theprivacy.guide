#### Why This Matters
Clicking a malicious link can instantly download malware, steal your passwords, or compromise your accounts. It's like giving a stranger your house key - once they're in, they can take everything.

Criminals create fake websites that look exactly like real ones (banks, social media, shopping sites) to steal your login information. A simple hover check takes 2 seconds and can save you from identity theft and financial fraud.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* A quick 3-second safety check you can use on any link
* The ability to spot fake websites before visiting them
* Protection from malware, phishing, and identity theft

### Step 1: The Hover Test
Learn to safely preview where any link goes before clicking.

1. Move your mouse over the link (don't click yet!)
2. Look at the bottom-left corner of your browser window
3. Read the actual destination that appears there
4. Compare it to what you expected

**Examples:**
* ✅ `amazon.com/your-order` in an Amazon email = Good
* ❌ `amazn-security.net` in an "Amazon" email = Fake
* ✅ `paypal.com/account` in a PayPal message = Good
* ❌ `secure-paypal-update.com` in a "PayPal" message = Fake

### Step 2: Spot Fake Domains
Recognize the tricks scammers use to fool you.

1. Look for character substitutions: `m1crosoft.com` (1 instead of i)
2. Watch for extra words: `chase-bank-security.com` instead of `chase.com`
3. Check the extension: `.net` or `.org` instead of `.com`
4. When in doubt, type the company name directly into your browser

**Remember:** If it doesn't look exactly like the real company's website address, don't click it.

### Step 3: When in Doubt, Go Direct
The safest way to check any suspicious message.

1. Don't click the link in the email or text
2. Open a new browser tab
3. Type the company's official website directly (like `amazon.com`)
4. Log into your account normally
5. Check if there are any real notifications waiting for you

**Example:** Email says "Your Amazon order has a problem"? Go to Amazon.com directly and check your orders there instead.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've learned a 3-second safety check that protects you from malicious websites, identity theft, and malware. This simple hover technique works on every link, everywhere.

**What to Expect**
You'll start noticing suspicious links immediately and feel confident about what's safe to click. Most scam attempts will become obvious once you know what to look for.

**Pro Tips**
* Trust your browser's security warnings - they're trying to protect you
* When something feels urgent or too good to be true, take a moment to verify
* If a shortened link (bit.ly, tinyurl) seems suspicious, paste it into urlex.org to see where it really goes

**Remember:** Taking 3 seconds to hover and check a link can save you from hours of dealing with compromised accounts and stolen information.
