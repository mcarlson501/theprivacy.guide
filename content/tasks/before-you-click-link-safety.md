#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)
Clicking a malicious link can instantly compromise your device, steal your passwords, or download malware. Learning how to safely verify links before clicking is like having a digital bodyguard that protects you from online threats.

#### What This Accomplishes (How It Helps)
* **Prevents malware infections:** Stop viruses and spyware from getting on your device
* **Protects your passwords:** Avoid fake login pages designed to steal your credentials
* **Keeps your data safe:** Prevent identity theft and financial fraud
* **Builds smart habits:** Develop the reflexes that keep you safe online every day

### Step 1: The Hover Test (Your First Line of Defense)

**How to safely preview any link:**
1. **Don't click yet!** Move your mouse cursor over the link
2. **Look at the bottom-left corner** of your browser window
3. **Read the actual destination** that appears there
4. **Compare it to what you expected**

**What you're looking for:**
* ‚úÖ `amazon.com/your-order` in an Amazon email
* ‚ùå `amazn-security.net` in an "Amazon" email
* ‚úÖ `paypal.com/account` in a PayPal message
* ‚ùå `secure-paypal-update.com` in a "PayPal" message

**Pro tip:** The real domain is right before the first single forward slash. Everything after doesn't matter as much.

### Step 2: Decode Shortened URLs Safely

**Common short links that hide the real destination:**
* `bit.ly/abc123`
* `tinyurl.com/xyz789`
* `t.co/random123`

**Safe way to check what's behind them:**
1. **Copy the short link** (right-click, copy link)
2. **Paste it into a URL checker:** Go to `urlex.org` or `checkshorturl.com`
3. **See the real destination** before visiting
4. **Decide if it's safe** based on the actual website

**Quick rule:** If someone is hiding where a link goes, ask yourself why. Legitimate sources usually use direct links.

### Step 3: Look for Suspicious Domain Tricks

**Common scammer tactics:**

**Character substitution:**
* Real: `microsoft.com` ‚ùå Fake: `m1crosoft.com` (1 instead of i)
* Real: `google.com` ‚ùå Fake: `g00gle.com` (zeros instead of o's)

**Extra words:**
* Real: `chase.com` ‚ùå Fake: `chase-bank-security.com`
* Real: `apple.com` ‚ùå Fake: `apple-support-center.com`

**Wrong extensions:**
* Real: `netflix.com` ‚ùå Fake: `netflix.net` or `netflix.org`

**Quick check:** Type the company name directly into your browser instead of clicking the suspicious link.

---

### Step 4: Verify Through Official Channels

**When you're unsure about any link:**

1. **Don't click it** - resist the urge, even if it seems urgent
2. **Open a new browser tab**
3. **Type the company's official website** directly (like `amazon.com`)
4. **Log into your account normally**
5. **Check if there are any real notifications** waiting for you

**Example:** Got an email saying "Your Amazon order has a problem"? Go directly to Amazon.com and check your orders instead of clicking the email link.

---

### Step 5: Use Browser Safety Features

**Built-in protection you already have:**

**Chrome users:**
* Look for "Not secure" warnings in the address bar
* Trust the red warning pages that say "Deceptive site ahead"

**Firefox users:**
* Watch for the shield icon that blocks trackers
* Pay attention to "This connection is not secure" warnings

**Safari users:**
* Notice "Not Secure" labels in the address bar
* Trust warnings about "This website may be impersonating..."

**Don't ignore these warnings!** Your browser is trying to protect you.

---

### Step 6: The "Does This Make Sense?" Check

**Before clicking any link, ask yourself:**
* **Did I request this?** (Password reset I didn't ask for = suspicious)
* **Is this how this company usually contacts me?** (Bank sending links via email = unusual)
* **Is the timing realistic?** (Package delivery at 2 AM = probably fake)
* **Does the message match the link?** (Says Netflix but goes to random site = red flag)

**Trust your instincts:** If something feels off, it probably is.

Before clicking any link:
1. **Hover first** - What's the real destination?
