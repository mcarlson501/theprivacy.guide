#### Why This Matters
QR codes can take you anywhere on the internet with just a scan, but you can't see where they're going until after you scan them. Scammers exploit this by placing fake QR codes over real ones at restaurants, parking meters, and businesses to steal your money or personal information.

Unlike a website address you can read, QR codes hide their destination. This makes them perfect for scams - you might think you're paying for parking but actually sending money to a criminal's account.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* The ability to spot suspicious QR codes before scanning them
* Safe habits for when you do need to scan legitimate codes
* Knowledge of what to do if you accidentally scan a malicious code

### Step 1: Spot Suspicious QR Codes
Learn to identify fake or dangerous QR codes before scanning.

**Major red flags:**
1. QR code stickers placed over existing codes (always a scam)
2. Handwritten signs saying "Scan for WiFi" or "Free internet"
3. Random QR codes on cars, telephone poles, or bathroom walls
4. Codes in emails from unknown senders

**Before scanning any QR code, ask:** Was I expecting this? Do I trust the source? Is there another way to get this information?

### Step 2: Scan Safely When You Do Need To
If you must scan a QR code, do it the safe way.

1. Use your phone's built-in camera (more secure than third-party apps)
2. **Don't tap immediately** - preview the URL first
3. iPhone: Hold down the notification to see the full website address
4. Android: Look at the preview before tapping "Open"
5. Check if the website address matches what you expected
6. Look for "https://" and the lock icon before entering any information

**If the website looks suspicious or asks for unexpected information, close it immediately.**

### Step 3: Use Smart Alternatives
Often there are safer ways to get what you need.

**Instead of scanning unknown QR codes:**
1. Ask staff: "What's your website?" or "Can I get a physical menu?"
2. Search online: Look up the business name + what you need
3. Use official apps from the App Store/Google Play
4. For payments: Use your credit card, Apple Pay, or established payment apps

**Remember:** There's nothing you can get from a QR code that you can't get by typing a website address directly.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've learned to identify suspicious QR codes and scan them safely when necessary. This protects you from one of the newest and fastest-growing scam methods that can steal your money or personal information.

**What to Expect**
You'll start noticing suspicious QR codes everywhere and feel confident about which ones are safe to scan. You'll have alternative ways to access information without taking unnecessary risks.

**Pro Tips**
* When in doubt, don't scan - ask for the website address instead
* Never download apps from QR codes - use official app stores only
* If you see a suspicious QR code, alert the business or remove it if possible

**Remember:** QR codes are just shortcuts to websites. The convenience isn't worth the risk when you can't verify the source. Your cautious approach will save you from financial scams and identity theft.
