#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)
QR codes are like digital doorways‚Äîthey can take you anywhere on the internet with just a scan. While legitimate businesses use them for menus, payments, and information, scammers have discovered they can easily trick people into visiting malicious websites by placing fake QR codes over real ones or posting them in public places. Unlike typed URLs where you can see where you're going, QR codes hide their destination until after you scan them.

#### What This Accomplishes (How It Helps)
* **Prevents financial theft:** Avoid fake payment QR codes that steal your money
* **Protects personal data:** Stop malicious codes from accessing your phone's information
* **Avoids malware:** Prevent downloading harmful apps or visiting dangerous websites
* **Builds awareness:** Develop habits that keep you safe in our QR code-filled world
* **Saves money:** Avoid scams that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars

### Step 1: Understand QR Code Risks

#### Common QR Code Scams ("Quishing")
**Fake Payment Codes:**
* Scammers place stickers with their QR codes over legitimate ones
* You think you're paying the restaurant, but money goes to the scammer
* Common at parking meters, food trucks, and small businesses

**Malicious Website Codes:**
* QR codes that take you to fake login pages
* Designed to steal your passwords and personal information
* Often disguised as "free WiFi" or "special offers"

**App Download Tricks:**
* Codes that prompt you to download a "required" app
* The app may be malware designed to steal your data
* Often seen with fake "security alerts" or "urgent updates"

### Step 2: Safe QR Code Scanning Habits

#### Before You Scan
1. **Look for tampering:** Check if the QR code looks like a sticker placed over another one
2. **Consider the source:** Is this QR code from a legitimate, established business?
3. **Ask yourself:** Do I really need to scan this right now, or can I find the information another way?

#### The Safe Scanning Process
1. **Use your phone's built-in camera** (most secure option)
2. **Preview the URL** before visiting:
   - iPhone: Hold down on the notification to see the full URL
   - Android: Look at the preview before tapping "Open"
3. **Check the website address** - does it match what you expect?
4. **Look for HTTPS** (the lock icon) before entering any information

### Step 3: Red Flags to Never Ignore

#### Suspicious QR Code Locations
* **Stuck on top of existing codes:** Always a scam
* **Handwritten signs saying "Scan for WiFi":** Usually fake
* **Random QR codes on cars, poles, or walls:** Avoid completely
* **Codes in emails from unknown senders:** Delete the email

#### Dangerous Website Signs After Scanning
* **Immediate download prompts:** Never download apps from QR codes
* **Login requests for accounts you didn't expect:** Likely phishing
* **"Urgent security alerts":** Legitimate companies don't work this way
* **Requests for credit card info:** Only enter payment details on sites you navigated to intentionally

### Step 4: Smart Alternatives to QR Codes

#### Instead of Scanning Unknown QR Codes
1. **Ask staff directly:** "What's your website URL?" or "How do I access your menu?"
2. **Search online:** Look up the business name + what you need (menu, hours, etc.)
3. **Use official apps:** Download restaurant or business apps from official app stores
4. **Type URLs manually:** If you see a QR code, ask for the website address instead

#### For Payments
* **Use established payment apps:** Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay
* **Pay with cards directly:** Tap, insert, or swipe your actual card
* **Cash is still king:** Sometimes the old way is the safest way

### Step 5: What to Do If You've Been Scammed

#### If You Scanned a Malicious QR Code
1. **Don't panic, but act quickly**
2. **Close the browser/app immediately**
3. **Check your recent downloads** - delete anything suspicious
4. **Change passwords** for any accounts you may have entered
5. **Monitor bank/credit card statements** for unusual activity

#### If You Made a Payment
1. **Contact your bank/credit card company immediately**
2. **Report the fraudulent charge**
3. **Take photos** of the fake QR code if still there
4. **Report to local police** and the business where it happened

---

### Step 6: Teach Others

#### Share This Knowledge
* **Tell family and friends:** Especially older relatives who may be more trusting
* **Point out suspicious QR codes:** Help businesses and other customers stay safe
* **Lead by example:** Let others see you checking URLs before visiting sites

#### Simple Rules to Remember
1. **"When in doubt, don't scan"** - There's usually another way to get the information
2. **"Check before you click"** - Always preview the URL
3. **"Real businesses don't rush you"** - Legitimate QR codes don't create urgency

### üéØ Success Checklist

By the end of this task, you should:
- [  ] Know how to identify suspicious QR code locations
- [  ] Understand how to safely preview URLs before visiting
- [  ] Have alternative methods for accessing business information
- [  ] Know what to do if you accidentally scan a malicious code
- [  ] Feel confident saying "no" to scanning random QR codes
- [  ] Be ready to help others avoid QR code scams

**üèÜ Congratulations!** You're now protected against one of the newest and fastest-growing types of scams. Your cautious approach to QR codes will save you from potential financial loss and identity theft.

**What tech people know that you don't:** QR codes are just shortcuts to websites - there's nothing you can get from a QR code that you can't get by typing a URL directly. The convenience isn't worth the risk when the source is unknown. Most legitimate businesses will happily give you their website address if you ask!

**Pro tip:** Many restaurants and businesses that use QR codes also have physical menus or websites you can access normally. Don't feel pressured to scan - there's almost always an alternative way to get what you need.
