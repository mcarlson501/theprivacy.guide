#### Why This Matters
Every time you visit a website, dozens of invisible trackers record what you looked at, how long you stayed, and follow you to the next site. Regular browsers like Chrome allow this by default because Google makes money from advertising. Over time, these trackers build a detailed profile of your interests, shopping habits, health concerns, and more.

Switching to a privacy-focused browser (or adjusting your current one) blocks most of this tracking automatically. You still see the same websites and they work the same way — the only difference is that companies can no longer spy on your browsing.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* A browser that automatically blocks trackers and invasive ads
* Protection from websites following you across the internet
* A faster browsing experience (blocking trackers actually speeds things up)

### Step 1: Choose Your Privacy Browser
Pick the option that fits your comfort level.

**Option A — Firefox (Recommended for most people):**
1. Go to mozilla.org/firefox on your computer
2. Click "Download Firefox" and install it
3. On your phone, search "Firefox" in the App Store or Google Play and install it
4. Open Firefox — it blocks trackers by default, no extra setup needed

**Option B — Brave (Strongest privacy out of the box):**
1. Go to brave.com on your computer
2. Click "Download Brave" and install it
3. On your phone, search "Brave" in your app store and install it
4. Open Brave — it blocks trackers, ads, and fingerprinting automatically

**Option C — Keep Safari (Good for Apple users):**
1. If you're already using Safari on Mac or iPhone, you're in decent shape
2. Safari blocks many trackers by default
3. Skip to Step 2 to make sure the best settings are turned on

**Note:** Firefox and Brave are both free. They look and work just like Chrome — you type in web addresses, use bookmarks, and browse the same websites.

### Step 2: Turn On the Best Privacy Settings
Make sure your new browser is set up for maximum protection.

**Firefox:**
1. Click the three-line menu (☰) → Settings → Privacy & Security
2. Under "Enhanced Tracking Protection," select "Strict"
3. Scroll down to "Cookies and Site Data" → Check "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"
4. Under "History," choose "Firefox will: Use custom settings" and check "Clear history when Firefox closes"

**Brave:**
1. Click the three-line menu → Settings → Shields
2. Make sure "Shields" is set to "Aggressive"
3. Go to Settings → Privacy and Security
4. Turn ON "Clear browsing data on exit" for cookies and cached files

**Safari:**
1. Go to Safari → Settings (or Preferences) → Privacy
2. Check "Prevent cross-site tracking"
3. Check "Hide IP address from trackers"
4. On iPhone: Settings → Safari → Turn ON "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" and "Hide IP Address"

### Step 3: Import Your Bookmarks and Passwords
Bring everything from your old browser so you don't lose anything.

1. Open your new browser (Firefox or Brave)
2. Look for a prompt that says "Import from another browser" (usually appears on first launch)
3. If you don't see it: go to Settings → "Import browser data" or "Import bookmarks"
4. Select your old browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari) and check all the boxes
5. Click "Import" — your bookmarks, saved passwords, and browsing history will transfer over

**Note:** This only takes a moment and means you won't lose any saved websites or passwords. Your old browser still works too — you can use both while you get comfortable.

### Step 4: Make It Your Default Browser
Set your privacy browser as the one that opens automatically.

**On a computer:**
1. Open your new browser
2. Go to Settings and look for "Make Default Browser" or "Default Browser"
3. Click it and confirm

**On iPhone:**
1. Go to Settings → scroll down and tap your browser name (Firefox or Brave)
2. Tap "Default Browser App"
3. Select your privacy browser

**On Android:**
1. Go to Settings → Apps → Default Apps
2. Tap "Browser app"
3. Select your privacy browser

**Why this matters:** If your old browser is still the default, links from emails and messages will still open in Chrome and get tracked. Setting your new browser as the default makes sure you're always protected.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've switched to a browser that blocks invisible trackers, stops websites from following you across the internet, and protects your browsing privacy automatically. You don't have to think about it — the browser does the work for you.

**What to Expect**
Websites look and work exactly the same. Pages may actually load faster because the browser is blocking heavy tracking scripts and ads. Occasionally, a website might not work perfectly — if that happens, try it in your old browser as a backup.

**Pro Tips**
* Keep your old browser installed as a backup for the rare site that doesn't work properly
* Add the uBlock Origin extension to Firefox for even stronger ad and tracker blocking (Brave doesn't need this — it's built in)
* Use private/incognito mode for sensitive searches (medical questions, financial topics) even in your privacy browser for extra protection

**Remember:** Your browser is the window through which you see the entire internet. By choosing one that respects your privacy, you've blocked one of the biggest tracking systems watching your online life.
