#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)
Text message phishing (called "smishing") is exploding because scammers know you're more likely to trust and immediately respond to texts. Unlike emails, SMS messages feel personal and urgent, making them incredibly effective at tricking people into sharing sensitive information or clicking malicious links.

#### What This Accomplishes (How It Helps)
* **Protects your mobile device:** Prevent malware designed specifically for phones
* **Safeguards personal info:** Stop identity thieves from gathering your data through texts
* **Saves you money:** Avoid falling for fake payment and refund scams
* **Keeps you alert:** Develop the instincts to spot mobile-specific threats

### Step 1: Recognize Common SMS Phishing Patterns

**Fake delivery notifications:**
* "Your package couldn't be delivered. Click here to reschedule: [suspicious link]"
* "USPS: Your package is being held. Update your address here: [malicious link]"
* "FedEx: Package delayed. Track your shipment: [scam link]"

**Red flags:** Real delivery services rarely text you links. They usually just say "delivered" or give you a tracking number to look up yourself.

**Account "verification" scams:**
* "Your Amazon account has been suspended. Verify here: [fake link]"
* "Apple ID will be locked. Confirm your identity: [phishing link]"
* "Bank alert: Unusual activity detected. Secure your account: [scam link]"

**Reality check:** Legitimate companies don't send urgent "verify or lose access" texts with links.

**Prize and giveaway texts:**
* "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card. Claim here: [malicious link]"
* "You've been selected for a free iPhone. Just pay shipping: [scam site]"
* "Walmart survey winner! Collect your prize: [fake link]"

**Truth:** You can't win contests you never entered, and real prizes don't require "shipping fees."

### Step 2: Spot the Mobile-Specific Red Flags

**Suspicious sender numbers:**
* **Short codes from unknown sources:** Like 5-digit numbers (12345) claiming to be major companies
* **International numbers:** +1-800 numbers from abroad are often fake
* **Random long numbers:** 10+ digit numbers that don't look like real phone numbers

**Timing red flags:**
* Texts arriving at odd hours (2 AM package delivery notifications?)
* Multiple urgent messages in quick succession
* Messages about services you don't use (Netflix when you don't have Netflix)

**Language tells:**
* Generic greetings: "Dear customer" instead of your name
* Urgent action phrases: "Act now," "expires today," "immediate action required"
* Poor grammar that doesn't match the professional company they claim to be

### Step 3: The Safe Way to Handle Suspicious Texts

**Never click links in suspicious texts.** Instead:

**For delivery notifications:**
1. Open your actual delivery app (UPS, FedEx, Amazon)
2. Check your tracking numbers there
3. If you weren't expecting a package, it's definitely fake

**For account alerts:**
1. Open the company's official app or website directly
2. Log in normally using your saved password
3. Check for any real alerts or notifications
4. If there's nothing there, the text was fake

**For banking alerts:**
1. Call your bank directly using the number on your card
2. Ask if they sent you any notifications
3. Don't call numbers provided in the suspicious text

### Step 4: What to Do If You Already Clicked

**If you clicked a link but didn't enter information:**
1. **Don't panic** - viewing a website usually isn't harmful by itself
2. **Close the browser immediately**
3. **Clear your browser cache** (search "clear cache" + your phone type)
4. **Monitor your accounts** for unusual activity over the next few days

**If you entered personal information:**
1. **Change passwords immediately** for any accounts that might be affected
2. **Contact your bank/credit card company** if you entered financial info
3. **Monitor your credit reports** for new accounts you didn't open
4. **Consider freezing your credit** temporarily for extra protection

**If you downloaded something:**
1. **Don't open the file**
2. **Delete it immediately**
3. **Run a security scan** if your phone has antivirus software
4. **Watch for unusual phone behavior** (slow performance, unexpected apps, high data usage)

### Step 5: Set Up Mobile Defenses

**iPhone users:**
1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Messages**
2. **Turn on "Filter Unknown Senders"** - moves suspicious texts to a separate list
3. **Turn off "iMessage"** from unknown contacts (Settings ‚Üí Messages ‚Üí Send & Receive)
4. **Report spam:** Forward spam texts to 7726 (SPAM)

**Android users:**
1. **Open Messages app ‚Üí 3 dots ‚Üí Settings**
2. **Turn on "Spam protection"**
3. **Block unknown senders** in advanced settings
4. **Use Google Messages** if you're not already - it has better spam filtering

**For all phones:**
* **Don't reply to suspicious texts** - even "STOP" can confirm your number is active
* **Block and delete** obvious spam messages
* **Never give out your real number** on sketchy websites or forms

### Step 6: Teach Family Members the Basics

**Share these simple rules with family:**
* **"If you didn't order it, it's not coming"** - ignore delivery texts for packages you didn't order
* **"When in doubt, check another way"** - always verify urgent messages through official channels
* **"Free things aren't free"** - ignore prize and giveaway texts
* **"Tell someone if you're unsure"** - better to ask than to get scammed

**Especially important for:**
* **Elderly family members** who may be less familiar with these scams
* **Teenagers** who might be more impulsive about clicking links
* **Anyone who does a lot of online shopping** and might expect delivery notifications

### Quick Reference: The 5-Second SMS Safety Check

Before acting on any text message:
1. **Do I recognize this number?** (Unknown = be suspicious)
2. **Was I expecting this message?** (Unexpected = red flag)
3. **Is it creating urgency?** (Pressure = warning sign)
4. **Does the message match reality?** (Check your accounts independently)
5. **Would this company really text me this?** (When in doubt, they probably wouldn't)
