#### Why This Matters
Text message scams (called "smishing") are exploding because people trust texts more than emails. Scammers know you're more likely to click a link in a text because it feels personal and urgent. These messages can steal your passwords, install malware on your phone, or trick you into paying fake fees.

Text scams often look like delivery notifications, bank alerts, or account problems. They create fake urgency to make you act without thinking. Learning to spot these takes just a few minutes but can save you from identity theft and financial fraud.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* The ability to quickly identify fake text messages before clicking anything
* Knowledge of how to safely verify suspicious messages
* Your phone set up to filter and block spam texts automatically

### Step 1: Recognize the Most Common Scam Texts
Learn to spot the messages that fool most people.

**Fake package delivery:**
* "Your package couldn't be delivered. Click here to reschedule"
* "USPS: Package being held. Update your address here"
* "FedEx: Package delayed. Track your shipment"

**Fake account alerts:**
* "Your Amazon account has been suspended. Verify here"
* "Apple ID will be locked. Confirm your identity"
* "Bank alert: Unusual activity detected. Secure your account"

**Fake prizes:**
* "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card"
* "You've been selected for a free iPhone. Just pay shipping"

**Remember:** You can't win contests you never entered, and real companies don't send urgent "click or lose access" texts.

### Step 2: Check for Red Flags
Look for signs that immediately reveal fake messages.

1. **Check the sender number:** Weird numbers like 5-digit codes or international numbers
2. **Look at the timing:** Package delivery alerts at 2 AM? Suspicious
3. **Read the language:** "Dear customer" instead of your name, urgent phrases like "act now"
4. **Ask yourself:** Was I expecting this? Do I even use this service?

**Big red flag:** Any text that creates urgency and asks you to click a link immediately.

### Step 3: Verify Before You Click
The safe way to check if a message is real.

**Never click links in suspicious texts.** Instead:

**For package notifications:**
1. Open your actual delivery app (UPS, FedEx, Amazon)
2. Check your tracking numbers there
3. If nothing shows up and you weren't expecting a package, it's fake

**For account alerts:**
1. Open the company's official app or website directly
2. Log in with your normal password
3. Look for any real alerts or notifications
4. If there's nothing there, the text was a scam

**For banking messages:**
1. Call your bank using the number on your debit card
2. Ask if they sent you any notifications
3. Never call numbers provided in the suspicious text
