#### Why This Matters
Online shopping is convenient, but it's also where criminals make a lot of money. Fake websites that look just like real stores steal credit card numbers every day. Even legitimate sites can be breached, exposing your payment information. And every store you buy from ends up with your name, address, email, and card number in their database.

A few simple habits can protect your money without making shopping harder. You don't need to be a tech expert — you just need to know what to look for before you click "Buy."

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Learned how to instantly spot fake shopping websites before entering any information
* Discovered simple ways to protect your credit card number when shopping online
* Built quick safety habits that take just seconds but prevent most online shopping scams

### Step 1: Spot Fake Websites Before You Buy
Learn the warning signs that a shopping site is not what it claims to be.

**Check the web address (URL) carefully:**
1. Look at the website address in your browser's address bar
2. Make sure it matches the real company (amazon.com, not amaz0n-deals.com)
3. Watch for misspellings, extra words, or strange extensions (.shop, .buzz, .top instead of .com)
4. Make sure the address starts with "https://" — the "s" means the connection is secure

**Red flags that scream "fake site":**
- Prices that are way too good to be true (80-90% off everything)
- No physical address or phone number on the website
- Only accepts unusual payment methods (wire transfer, gift cards, cryptocurrency)
- Poor grammar and spelling throughout the site
- No return policy or a vague one

**Quick test:** Search the store name plus "scam" or "review" before buying from any site you haven't used before. A few seconds of searching can save you a lot of trouble.

### Step 2: Protect Your Payment Information
Use simple tricks to keep your credit card number safe.

**Use a credit card, not a debit card:**
- Credit cards have fraud protection — if someone steals your number, the bank covers it
- Debit cards pull money directly from your bank account, which is much harder to get back
- This is the single most important online shopping safety rule

**Try virtual card numbers:**
- Many banks now offer virtual or temporary card numbers for online purchases
- Check your bank's app or website for "virtual cards" or "digital cards"
- Each number is unique to one purchase, so if the store gets hacked, your real card number is safe
- Services like Privacy.com also let you create virtual cards for free

**Never save your card on file:**
- Uncheck "Save this card for future purchases" at checkout
- Yes, it means typing your card number each time, but it also means fewer places storing it
- If a store you shopped at gets breached, your card isn't in their database

### Step 3: Use Safe Shopping Habits
Build these quick habits into your routine.

**Before every purchase, ask:**
1. Did I get to this site by typing the address myself or searching for it? (Safe)
2. Or did I click a link in an email, text, or social media ad? (Risky — verify the URL)
3. Have I bought from this store before? If not, did I check reviews?

**Protect your information:**
- Use your secondary/shopping email for store accounts (not your main email)
- Don't create an account if "Guest checkout" is available
- Give the minimum information required — skip optional fields like birthday and phone number
- Be cautious of "Sign in with Google/Facebook" — this shares your social account data with the store

**After a purchase:**
- Save your order confirmation email
- Check your credit card statement for the correct charge amount
- If you see a charge you don't recognize, call your credit card company immediately

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You now know how to spot fake shopping websites, protect your payment information, and shop with simple safety habits. These skills protect you every time you buy something online.

**What to Expect**
Shopping works exactly the same — you just have a quick mental checklist to run before entering your payment details. The few extra seconds it takes to verify a website or type in your card number (instead of saving it) are well worth the protection.

**Pro Tips**
* Bookmark your favorite shopping sites so you always go to the real ones instead of clicking links
* If a deal arrives by email, go directly to the store's website instead of clicking the email link
* Keep an eye on your credit card statements — catching a fraudulent charge early makes it much easier to fix

**Remember:** Most online shopping scams succeed because people are in a hurry. Taking just a few seconds to check the website and protect your payment details stops the vast majority of online fraud.
