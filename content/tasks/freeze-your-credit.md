#### Why This Matters
Identity theft is one of the most common crimes in America, and the damage can take months or even years to fix. Criminals use stolen personal information — your name, address, Social Security number — to open credit cards, take out loans, and rack up debt in your name. You usually don't find out until a bill collector calls or you get denied for a loan.

A credit freeze is like putting a lock on your credit file. It's completely free, takes just a few minutes, and it's the single most powerful thing you can do to prevent identity theft. Even if a criminal has all your personal information, they can't open new accounts because lenders can't access your frozen credit file.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Locked your credit at all three major bureaus so no one can open accounts in your name
* Protected yourself from the most damaging form of identity theft — for free
* Learned how to temporarily lift the freeze when you actually need to apply for credit

### Step 1: Freeze Your Credit at Equifax
You need to freeze at all three bureaus because lenders can check any of them. Start with Equifax.

1. Go to equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/
2. Click "Place a Freeze"
3. Create an account if you don't have one (you'll need your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth)
4. Follow the steps to complete the freeze
5. Save the PIN or confirmation number they give you — you'll need this to unfreeze later

**Important:** Write down your PIN and keep it somewhere safe. You'll need it if you want to apply for a credit card or loan in the future.

### Step 2: Freeze Your Credit at Experian
Now do the same thing at the second bureau.

1. Go to experian.com/freeze/center.html
2. Click "Add a Security Freeze"
3. Fill in your personal information to verify your identity
4. Complete the freeze process
5. Save the PIN or confirmation they provide

**Note:** Experian may try to sell you a paid credit monitoring service during this process. You do not need to buy anything. The freeze itself is always free by law.

### Step 3: Freeze Your Credit at TransUnion
Last one — after this, all three bureaus are locked.

1. Go to transunion.com/credit-freeze
2. Click "Add a Freeze"
3. Create an account or sign in
4. Verify your identity and complete the freeze
5. Save your PIN or confirmation number

**You're now protected at all three bureaus.** No one can open new credit accounts in your name without your permission.

### Step 4: Know How to Unfreeze When You Need To
A credit freeze doesn't lock you out — you control it.

**When you need to unfreeze:**
- Applying for a credit card or loan
- Renting an apartment (landlord credit check)
- Getting a new cell phone plan
- Starting certain utilities

**How to temporarily unfreeze:**
1. Go to the bureau's website (or call them)
2. Enter your PIN or log into your account
3. Choose "Temporarily lift freeze" and select a date range
4. The freeze automatically goes back in place after that date

**Note:** You can unfreeze at just one bureau if you know which one the lender uses. Ask the lender "Which credit bureau do you check?" to avoid unfreezing all three.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've placed the single most effective protection against identity theft. Your credit files are now locked at all three major bureaus. Even if criminals steal your personal information in a data breach, they cannot open new accounts in your name.

**What to Expect**
Nothing changes in your daily life. Your existing credit cards, loans, and accounts are not affected at all. The only time you'll notice the freeze is when you need to apply for new credit — and temporarily lifting it takes just a few minutes.

**Pro Tips**
* Store your PINs somewhere safe but accessible — a password manager is a great place for them
* Consider freezing your credit at the two smaller bureaus too: Innovis (innovis.com) and NCTUE (nctue.com) — same free process
* Check your free credit report once a year at annualcreditreport.com to make sure nothing suspicious has appeared

**Remember:** A credit freeze is free, has no effect on your credit score, and is the strongest defense against identity theft. This is one of the highest-impact privacy moves you can make.
