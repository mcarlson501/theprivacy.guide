#### Why This Matters
The National Do Not Call Registry is a free government service that tells legitimate telemarketers they're not allowed to call you. Companies that ignore this list can be fined up to $43,792 per call. While it won't stop scammers (they don't follow laws), it dramatically reduces legal marketing calls.

Most people don't know this service exists, so they suffer through years of dinner-time interruptions that could be stopped in 2 minutes. Registration never expires - you're protected for life once you sign up.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Significantly fewer telemarketing and sales calls within 31 days
* Legal protection against companies that continue to call you
* A way to report and fine companies that violate the registry

### Step 1: Register at the Official Government Site
Use only the real government website to avoid scams.

1. Go to **donotcall.gov** in your web browser (look for the ".gov" - this confirms it's official)
2. Click "Register Your Phone" (big blue button)
3. Enter your phone number with area code
4. Enter your email address for confirmation
5. Check your email and click the verification link

**Warning:** This service is completely free. Never pay money for "premium" do-not-call services - they're scams.

### Step 2: Know What Changes
Understand which calls will stop and which will continue.

**Calls that should stop within 31 days:**
* Telemarketing sales calls from legitimate companies
* Survey calls from market research companies
* Cold calls trying to sell you products or services

**Calls that will continue:**
* Scam calls (criminals don't follow laws)
* Political campaigns and charities
* Companies you already do business with
* Debt collectors (if you owe money)

### Step 3: Boost Your Protection
Add your phone's built-in spam blocking for extra protection.

**iPhone:** Settings → Phone → Silence Unknown Callers
**Android:** Phone app → Settings → Caller ID & spam → Filter spam calls

**Also contact your carrier for free spam protection:**
* Verizon: Call Guard
* AT&T: Call Protect  
* T-Mobile: Scam Shield

**Remember:** If companies continue calling after 31 days, report them at donotcall.gov - they can be fined up to $43,792 per illegal call.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've registered for a free government service that will significantly reduce telemarketing calls. Legitimate businesses must check this registry and stop calling you, or face massive fines.

**What to Expect**
Within 31 days, you should notice fewer sales calls interrupting your day. The calls that continue are likely from scammers (who don't follow laws) or exempt organizations like political campaigns.

**Pro Tips**
* Never say "yes" to unknown callers - scammers can record it to authorize fake charges
* Just hang up on unwanted calls - you don't owe strangers your time
* Report companies that keep calling you illegally at donotcall.gov

**Remember:** This registration never expires. You're now protected for life from most legitimate telemarketing calls with just this 2-minute setup.
