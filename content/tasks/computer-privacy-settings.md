#### Why This Matters
Your computer is constantly sending information back to Microsoft or Apple — what apps you use, what you type, where you are, and how you use your machine. Both companies have tracking features turned on by default that most people never know about.

Windows is especially aggressive about data collection. It has an advertising ID that tracks you across apps, a feature that records your activity history, and Cortana listening for your voice. Mac is better out of the box but still shares analytics, Siri recordings, and location data. A few minutes in your settings can shut most of this down.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Stopped your computer from sending your activity data to Microsoft or Apple
* Turned off the advertising ID and tracking features built into your operating system
* Disabled voice assistants from recording your conversations

### Step 1: Windows — Turn Off Activity Tracking
Stop Windows from recording and sharing what you do on your computer.

**Turn off your Advertising ID:**
1. Open Settings (click the gear icon in the Start menu)
2. Go to Privacy & Security → General
3. Turn OFF "Let apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID"
4. Turn OFF "Let websites show me locally relevant content by accessing my language list"
5. Turn OFF "Let Windows improve Start and search results by tracking app launches"

**Turn off Activity History:**
1. In Settings → Privacy & Security → Activity History
2. Turn OFF "Store my activity history on this device"
3. Click "Clear activity history" to delete what's already been collected

**Turn off Diagnostic Data:**
1. Settings → Privacy & Security → Diagnostics & Feedback
2. Change "Diagnostic data" to "Required diagnostic data only" (the minimum allowed)
3. Turn OFF "Improve inking and typing"
4. Turn OFF "Tailored experiences"
5. Turn OFF "Send optional diagnostic data"

**Note:** These settings won't change how Windows works day-to-day. They just stop it from reporting your behavior back to Microsoft.

### Step 2: Windows — Disable Voice and Search Tracking
Stop Cortana and Windows Search from collecting your data.

**Disable Cortana/Copilot:**
1. Settings → Privacy & Security → Speech
2. Turn OFF "Online speech recognition" (this stops sending your voice to Microsoft)

**Limit Windows Search:**
1. Settings → Privacy & Security → Search permissions
2. Under "History," turn OFF "Search history on this device"
3. Click "Clear device search history"
4. Under "More settings," turn OFF "Show search highlights"

**Lock Screen Privacy:**
1. Settings → Personalization → Lock Screen
2. Change "Lock screen status" to "None" (removes weather/news that track your interests)

### Step 3: Mac — Turn Off Analytics and Siri Data Sharing
Stop your Mac from sending your usage data to Apple.

**Turn off Analytics:**
1. Click the Apple menu → System Settings (or System Preferences on older Macs)
2. Go to Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements
3. Uncheck (turn off) ALL options:
   - "Share Mac Analytics"
   - "Improve Siri & Dictation"
   - "Share with App Developers"
   - "Share iCloud Analytics"

**Turn off Siri Data Collection:**
1. System Settings → Siri (or Siri & Spotlight)
2. Turn OFF "Improve Siri & Dictation" if not already done above
3. Consider turning off "Listen for 'Hey Siri'" if you don't use it
4. Click "Delete Siri & Dictation History" to remove past recordings

**Turn off Personalized Ads:**
1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising
2. Turn OFF "Personalized Ads"

### Step 4: Both Platforms — Lock Down Location and App Access
Control what your computer knows about where you are.

**Windows Location:**
1. Settings → Privacy & Security → Location
2. Turn OFF "Location services" (unless you specifically need it)
3. Click "Clear" under Location history

**Mac Location:**
1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services
2. Review each app and turn off location access for anything that doesn't need it
3. Scroll down to "System Services" → "Details" and turn off "Location-Based Suggestions"

**Camera and Microphone (Both Platforms):**
1. Go to Privacy settings → Camera / Microphone
2. Review which apps have access
3. Turn off access for any app that doesn't need your camera or microphone
4. Pay special attention to apps you don't recognize

**Note:** Your video calling apps (Zoom, Teams, FaceTime) do need camera and microphone access. Keep those enabled but question anything else.

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You've shut down the background tracking built into your computer's operating system. Microsoft or Apple will collect far less data about how you use your machine, what you search for, where you are, and what you say.

**What to Expect**
Your computer works exactly the same. You might notice fewer personalized suggestions in Windows Start menu or Spotlight, and ads in Windows apps won't be targeted to you. Everything else — your apps, files, internet, and email — works identically.

**Pro Tips**
* After major Windows updates, check these settings again — Microsoft sometimes resets them to defaults
* On Windows, consider using a local account instead of a Microsoft account for less tracking (Settings → Accounts)
* On Mac, review Privacy & Security settings after each macOS update for new options Apple may have added

**Remember:** Your computer sits at the center of your digital life. By locking down these settings, you've closed one of the largest and most overlooked sources of personal data collection.
