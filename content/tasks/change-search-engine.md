#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)
Think of your search engine like a personal assistant. Every time you ask it a question, it remembers what you asked, where you asked from, and what you clicked on. Some assistants use this memory to build a detailed profile about you to sell to advertisers. Our goal is to switch to an assistant that has a very bad memory on purpose—one that treats every question like the first time you've ever met.

#### What This Accomplishes (How It Helps)
* Stops your search engine from building a personal profile on you.
* Reduces the number of targeted ads you see around the web.
* Keeps your search history private and separate from your other online accounts (like Google or Microsoft).

### Option 1: The Easiest First Step
This is our top recommendation because it's free, effective, and takes only a few clicks to set up. It provides a massive privacy boost for the least amount of effort.

* **Recommendation:** **Use DuckDuckGo**
* **What it is:** A private search engine that doesn't track your searches.
* **How to do it:**
    1. Go to [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com) in your web browser
    2. Look for "Add DuckDuckGo to your browser" button or settings
    3. Follow the simple setup instructions for your specific browser
    4. Set DuckDuckGo as your default search engine when prompted

**Why DuckDuckGo?** They have a strict no-tracking policy, don't store your personal information, and still provide excellent search results. It's like having Google's power without the privacy invasion.

### Want to take it a step further?
The option above is fantastic for everyday privacy. However, if you want an even higher level of anonymity or are looking for more advanced features, this next option is a great choice.

* **Recommendation:** **Use Startpage**
* **What it is:** A search engine that gives you Google's powerful search results, but anonymously.
* **How to do it:**
    1. Visit [startpage.com](https://startpage.com)
    2. Click on "Make Startpage your homepage" or look for browser setup instructions
    3. Follow the setup process to make it your default search engine
    4. Optionally, explore their privacy settings for additional protection

**Why Startpage?** If you love Google's search results but hate the tracking, Startpage is perfect. They get Google's results for you anonymously, so you get the best of both worlds.
