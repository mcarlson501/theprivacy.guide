#### Why This Matters
AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot are incredibly powerful, but they're like having a conversation with a very smart stranger who remembers everything. Your conversations can be stored, reviewed by humans, and used to train future AI models. You can still get amazing benefits while protecting your privacy by learning what to share and what to keep private.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* Learned what types of information should never be shared with AI tools
* Mastered the art of using anonymous examples to get help without revealing personal details
* Created a simple safety checklist to use before every AI conversation

---

### Step 1: Know What Never to Share
These types of information should never go into any AI tool:

**Personal Details:**
- Full names (yours or others)
- Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers
- Email addresses or dates of birth
- Passwords or login credentials

**Financial Information:**
- Credit card or bank account numbers
- Tax documents or salary information
- Investment account details

**Work Secrets:**
- Client names or confidential information  
- Proprietary business strategies
- Unreleased product information
- Internal company communications

**Private Documents:**
- Medical records or legal documents
- Personal photos with identifying information
- Private family details

---

### Step 2: Use Anonymous Examples Instead
Get the help you need without sharing real information.

**Replace Real Names:**
- ❌ "My daughter Sarah Smith is applying to college..."
- ✅ "My teenage daughter is applying to college..."

**Use Placeholder Information:**
- ❌ "I make $75,000 and have $50,000 in student loans..."
- ✅ "What's a good strategy for someone with student debt?"

**Generalize Details:**
- ❌ "My company Acme Corp in Denver..."  
- ✅ "My company in a mid-sized city..."

**Describe Without Specifics:**
- ❌ Uploading actual contracts or screenshots with personal info
- ✅ "Help me write a professional email declining a meeting"

---

### Step 3: Create a Safety Checklist
Before using any AI tool, ask yourself:

**The Four Safety Questions:**
1. "Am I about to share anything personal or confidential?"
2. "Would I be comfortable if this conversation became public?"
3. "Can I get help without sharing specific details?"
4. "Does my employer allow this type of AI use?"

**Red Flag Situations:**
- Any request to upload documents
- Questions requiring personal details to answer
- Work tasks involving client information  
- Anything you wouldn't want your boss or competitors to see

**Green Light Situations:**
- General writing help and templates
- Learning new skills or concepts
- Creative projects without personal details
- Public information research

### The Bottom Line

**What You Just Accomplished**
You now know how to use AI tools safely by avoiding personal information, using anonymous examples, and applying a simple safety checklist. You can get all the benefits of AI assistance while protecting your privacy and security.

**Smart AI Strategy**
Think of AI tools like powerful strangers who remember everything. You can have great conversations and get excellent help, but you wouldn't share your Social Security number or company secrets with a stranger at a coffee shop.

**If You've Already Shared Too Much**
- Delete your conversation history in the AI tool
- Change any passwords you may have mentioned
- Contact the AI service about data deletion policies
- Inform your IT team if you shared work information

**Remember:** AI tools are incredibly helpful when used safely. The goal isn't to avoid them completely, but to use them in a way that protects your privacy and security while still getting great results.
