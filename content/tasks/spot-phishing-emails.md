#### The Big Picture (Why It's Important)
Phishing emails are like digital wolves in sheep's clothing - they look legitimate but are designed to steal your personal information, passwords, or money. Learning to spot these fakes is one of the most valuable skills you can develop to protect yourself online.

* **Keeps your contacts safe:** Prevent spreading malware to friends and family
* **Builds confidence:** Feel more secure when checking your email every day

### Step 1: Check the Sender's Email Address

**Look for these red flags:**

**Misspelled domains:**
* Real: `amazon.com` ‚ùå Fake: `amazn.com` or `amazon-security.com`
* Real: `paypal.com` ‚ùå Fake: `paypal-support.com` or `payp4l.com`

**Generic email addresses:**
* ‚ùå `noreply@gmail.com` claiming to be from your bank
* ‚ùå `support123@yahoo.com` claiming to be from Apple
* ‚úÖ Real companies use their own domains like `@chase.com` or `@apple.com`

**Quick test:** Hover your mouse over the sender's name (don't click!) to see the actual email address.

---

### Step 2: Spot Urgency and Fear Tactics

**Common phishing phrases to watch for:**
* "Your account will be closed in 24 hours!"
* "Urgent action required immediately"
* "Click here or lose access forever"
* "Suspicious activity detected - verify now"
* "You have won..." or "Congratulations, you've been selected"

**Reality check:** Real companies rarely create artificial urgency. They'll give you reasonable time and multiple notifications for important account issues.

### Step 3: Examine Links Before Clicking

**Safe way to check links:**
1. **Hover don't click:** Move your mouse over any link
2. **Look at the bottom left:** Your browser shows the real destination
3. **Check the domain:** Does it match the company claiming to send it?

**Red flag examples:**
* Email claims to be from Netflix but link goes to `netfl1x-security.com`
* Bank email but link goes to `secure-banking-update.net`
* Any link with random letters/numbers like `bit.ly/a8d9s2k`

**When in doubt:** Don't click the link! Instead, go directly to the company's website by typing their address in your browser.

---

### Step 4: Look for Poor Grammar and Formatting

**Phishing tells:**
* Obvious spelling mistakes and typos
* Awkward phrasing like "We are notice suspicious activity"
* Generic greetings: "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name
* Inconsistent fonts, colors, or logos that look "off"

**Remember:** Large companies have professional marketing teams and proofreaders. Poor quality often means fake email.

---

### Step 5: Question Unexpected Attachments

**Major red flags:**
* Unexpected zip files, especially from unknown senders
* Documents asking you to "enable macros" or "enable editing"
* Files with double extensions like `invoice.pdf.exe`
* Any attachment you weren't expecting, even from known contacts

**Safe approach:** When in doubt, call or text the person to ask if they sent you something before opening it.

### Quick Reference: The 5-Second Phishing Check

Before engaging with any email, ask yourself:
1. **Do I recognize this sender?** (Check the actual email address)
2. **Was I expecting this email?** (Unsolicited = suspicious)
3. **Is it creating urgency?** (Pressure tactics = red flag)
4. **Does the language feel right?** (Poor grammar = warning)
5. **Am I being asked to click or download?** (When in doubt, don't)
