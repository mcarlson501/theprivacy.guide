#### Why This Matters
Phishing emails are fake messages designed to steal your passwords, personal information, or money. They look like legitimate emails from banks, social media sites, or online stores, but they're actually from criminals.

Over 90% of cyberattacks start with a phishing email. Learning to spot these fakes takes just a few minutes but can save you from identity theft, drained bank accounts, and compromised accounts.

#### What You'll Accomplish
After completing this task, you will have:
* The ability to quickly identify suspicious emails before opening them
* Knowledge of the most common phishing tricks and red flags
* Confidence to safely navigate your inbox without falling for scams

### Step 1: Check the Sender's Email Address
Look for telltale signs that the email isn't from who it claims to be.

1. Hover your mouse over the sender's name to see the actual email address
2. Look for misspelled domains (amazn.com instead of amazon.com)
3. Watch for generic addresses (noreply@gmail.com claiming to be from your bank)
4. Verify real companies use their own domains (@chase.com, @apple.com)

**Note:** This is the fastest way to spot most phishing attempts.

### Step 2: Spot Urgency and Fear Tactics
Scammers create fake urgency to make you act without thinking.

1. Watch for phrases like "Your account will be closed in 24 hours!"
2. Be suspicious of "Urgent action required immediately"
3. Question "Click here or lose access forever" messages
4. Don't trust "You have won..." or prize notifications
5. Remember that real companies give you reasonable time for important issues

### Step 3: Examine Links Before Clicking
Never click suspicious links - check where they really go first.

1. Hover your mouse over any link without clicking
2. Look at the bottom left of your browser to see the real destination
3. Check if the domain matches the company claiming to send the email
4. When in doubt, go directly to the company's website instead of clicking the link

**Red flag examples:**
* Email claims to be from Netflix but link goes to `netfl1x-security.com`
* Bank email but link goes to `secure-banking-update.net`
* Any link with random letters/numbers like `bit.ly/a8d9s2k`

**When in doubt:** Don't click the link! Instead, go directly to the company's website by typing their address in your browser.

### Step 4: Look for Poor Grammar and Formatting

**Phishing tells:**
* Obvious spelling mistakes and typos
* Awkward phrasing like "We are notice suspicious activity"
* Generic greetings: "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name
* Inconsistent fonts, colors, or logos that look "off"

**Remember:** Large companies have professional marketing teams and proofreaders. Poor quality often means fake email.

### Step 5: Question Unexpected Attachments

**Major red flags:**
* Unexpected zip files, especially from unknown senders
* Documents asking you to "enable macros" or "enable editing"
* Files with double extensions like `invoice.pdf.exe`
* Any attachment you weren't expecting, even from known contacts
